## The why (description)

Our family LOVES cooking, it's more than sharing a meal, it's a reflection of who we are and how we express ourselves. We spend holidays talking about food, hours preparing a dish, and never stop talking about what the next meal will be. Since I'm one of the people that just kind of watches everyone else cook, I thought I'd contribute by making a central place for everyone to share recipes, a place that not only captures the meal, but also a place where we can reflect on the memories sitting around the table.

## The how (technology used)

1. CSS / SASS
2. React (Ant Design & Web Sockets)
