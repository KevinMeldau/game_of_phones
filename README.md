# Game of Phones

Game of Phones is a fully functional chat application that allows multiple users to chat and send images to each other.
For my final capstone project, I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and focus on functionality, rather than trying to make the app look good.

Feel free to login and test there app **[here](https://game-of-phones.vercel.app/)**. There is also a video demo of the app **[here](https://game-of-phones.vercel.app/)**.

In order to test the app, you'll need to login as a test user. Here are a list of test users you can login as:
