# Game of Phones

Game of Phones is a fully functional chat application that allows multiple users to chat and send images to each other.
For my final capstone project, I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and focus on functionality, rather than trying to make the app look good.

Feel free to login and test there app **[here](https://game-of-phones.vercel.app/)**. There is also a video demo of the app **[here](https://game-of-phones.vercel.app/)**.

In order to test the app, you'll need to login as a test user. Here are a list of test users you can login as:

| Username        | Password           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Owen_Sullivan      | 123123 |
| Patrick_Long      | 123123 |
| Frank_Salazar      | 123123 |
| Murphy_Potts      | 123123 |

## Technology Used

1. Sass
2. React (Ant Design & Web Sockets)

**What is Websocket**
According to MDN, The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to **open a two-way interactive communication session** between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can **send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server** for a reply. WebSocket helps you maintain two-way communication between the client(in my case React app) and the Server.
